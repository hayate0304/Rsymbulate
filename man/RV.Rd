\usage{
RV(probSpace, fun = function(x) x)
}
\arguments{
\item{probSpace}{(ProbabilitySpace): the underlying
probability space of the random variable.}

\item{fun}{(function, optional):  a function that maps draws from the
probability space to numbers.}
}
\value{
A RV
}
\description{
A random variable is a function which maps an outcome of
 a probability space to a number.  Simulating a random
 variable is a two-step process: first, a draw is taken
 from the underlying probability space; then, the function
 is applied to that draw to obtain the realized value of
 the random variable.

\examples{
# a single draw is a sequence of 0s and 1s, e.g., (0, 0, 1, 0, 1).
P = BoxModel(c(0, 1), size=5)
# X counts the number of 1s in the draw, e.g., 5
X = RV(P, sum)

# the function is the identity, so Y has a Normal(0, 1) distribution
Y = RV(Normal(0, 1)

# a single draw from BivariateNormal is a tuple of two numbers
P = BivariateNormal()
# Z is the smaller of the two numbers
Z = RV(P, min)
